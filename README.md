## A Simple Server with Python Flask

This is a simple skeleton Flask server project that works on any of the devices supported by Raspberry Pi (v1 / Zero / Zero W) architecture.

This project simply serves up `"Hello World!"` on port `:80` of your balena device.

The repo contains files that will help run the flask server and make it work correctly.
